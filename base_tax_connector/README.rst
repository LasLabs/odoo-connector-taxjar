Known Issues / Road Map
=======================

* In order for rates to work, the reference record must actually be saved.
  This is because the reference fields require explicit ``(model_name,id)``
  formatting, but with an unsaved record the ID is ``NewId``.
* Transaction refund method is on ``account.tax.transaction``, but it should
  possibly be on ``account.tax.transaction.line`` instead. This was done to
  simplify the addition of new adapters, but may over-complicate things.
* Add a registration system for connectors, with a more centralized method for
  determining if the connector should be used.
* Add a hook for the update of a tax transaction. TBD what would actually trigger
  an update, because invoices can't be edited.
* Need a way to handle tax differentiation at the invoice line item level, so
  connectors can send individual lines instead of just whole orders.
